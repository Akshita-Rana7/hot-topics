            <h2>Article-1 The Value Of Money</h2>

            <p>Money holds immense value in our lives, serving as a fundamental medium of exchange and a measure of value in economic transactions. Its significance extends beyond mere transactions; money symbolizes power, security, and freedom. With it, individuals can fulfill basic needs like food, clothing, and shelter, ensuring their well-being and security.<br><br>

                The value of money is not constant; it fluctuates due to inflation and changes in purchasing power. This concept underscores the "time value of money," highlighting how money available today is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its earning potential. Moreover, money plays a critical role in achieving life goals, providing education, healthcare, and a comfortable lifestyle, all of which are vital for personal development and satisfaction.<br><br>

                However, it's essential to acknowledge the limitations of money. While it can provide material comforts and security, it cannot buy intangible assets like time, love, or true happiness[1]. Money should be viewed as a tool to enhance life rather than an end. People who equate money with happiness may find themselves in a relentless pursuit of wealth at the expense of relationships and personal fulfillment.<br><br>

                In conclusion, the value of money is multifaceted. It provides the means to improve living standards and secure the future while also highlighting the importance of balancing financial goals with personal and emotional well-being.

            <h2>Article-2 GMO Food</h2>
            <img src="images/food-8073610_1280.jpg" alt="Researcher">
            <p>Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) have become a significant part of the global food supply, offering both benefits and controversies. GMO foods are derived from organisms whose DNA has been altered in ways that do not occur naturally. This alteration often aims to enhance certain traits, such as resistance to pests, herbicides, or extreme environmental conditions, or to improve nutritional content.<br><br>

                One of the main benefits of GMO foods is increased crop yields. By introducing genes that confer resistance to pests or diseases, crops can produce more food on the same amount of land, which is crucial as the global population grows. Additionally, some GMOs are engineered to withstand harsh environmental conditions like drought or salinity, helping farmers in challenging climates maintain their livelihoods.<br><br>

                Despite these advantages, GMO foods are surrounded by controversy. Environmentalists worry about the long-term impacts on ecosystems, such as the potential for GMO crops to cross-breed with wild plants, leading to unintended consequences. There are also concerns about the monopolization of the seed market by a few large corporations, which could impact farmer's rights and biodiversity.<br><br>

                In conclusion, while GMO foods offer promising solutions to some of the world's most pressing food challenges, they also raise important ethical, environmental, and health questions that require careful consideration and regulation.</p>

            <h2>Article-3 The View of World in 2100</h2>
            <img src="images/night-7683839_1280.jpg" alt="Future city">
            <p>As we peer into the year 2100, the world stands transformed by the advancements and challenges of the 21st century. The landscape is a blend of towering, eco-friendly skyscrapers and vast, interconnected green spaces, reflecting our evolved harmony with nature. Renewable energy sources dominate, with solar, wind, and fusion power driving cities and industries, drastically reducing the carbon footprint.<br><br>

                Climate change, though addressed, has left its mark. Coastal cities are fortified with advanced barriers, and urban planning has adapted to unpredictable weather patterns. Inhabitants live in smart homes integrated with AI, optimizing energy use and enhancing security and comfort. Virtual reality and augmented reality redefine work, education, and entertainment, creating a society where physical and digital realms merge seamlessly.<br><br>

                Societal structures emphasize inclusivity and equality, with universal basic income and advanced healthcare ensuring a high standard of living. Genetic editing and nanotechnology have eradicated many diseases, extending average lifespans and enhancing human capabilities. Despite these advancements, ethical considerations surrounding technology and privacy continue to challenge societies, requiring constant vigilance and dialogue.<br><br>

                In this envisioned future, humanity balances technological prowess with sustainability and ethical considerations, striving to create a world that reflects both our potential and our responsibility to future generations.<br><br>

                Transportation has undergone a revolution. Autonomous electric vehicles navigate smart roads, while Hyperloop systems and drone highways connect major cities, significantly reducing travel time. Space travel has become a reality, with lunar and Martian colonies forming part of humanity's extended habitat.</p>
